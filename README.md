# MNIST Transformer classification

This project explores the application of Transformer-based architectures for image classification using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) in 28x28 pixel resolution
We look at the performance of transformers on simple image classification tasks like MNIST, comparing them with traditional CNN architectures.

The following are the metrics i obtained from tracking with WanB
